  <h1>NAICS API</h1>

  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/">North American Industry Classification System</a>
    (NAICS) is used by the U.S. Federal Government to organize different types of
    businesses economic analysis purposes, and while there are different types of
    numbering systems out there that do this, a lot of local municipalities have
    also started adopting it for their own business classification purposes. The
    NAICS codes and descriptions are revised every five years (latest: 2012;
    next: 2017), and while information is freely provided as PDFs or Excel
    spreadsheets and hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau, no machine-readable API
    exists for retrieving this data that can be easily used in applications.
    Until now.
