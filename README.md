# NAICS-API

[NAICS](http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/) (North American Industry Classification System) is maintained by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics to classify business types. It is used for aggregating, presenting, and analyzing data and trends in the US economy.

The classification system is currently hosted by the [Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/) and provided in various Excel and PDF documents, with some rudimentary HTML output and a not-so-great search tool.  Our goal is to improve on the Census Bureau's offerings by providing an API to make information machine-readable, with better search functionality, to assist with developing applications that depend on understanding or collecting information about businesses. 

## The Product

NAICS API is currently a Node.js server that returns NAICS data in a JSON format. Information stored on the server has been scraped or collected from files on the Census.gov web site. Most of the information for 2007 and 2012 has now been scraped thanks to the addition of a python scraper by Mike Migurski (see ``./data/scrape-examples-xrefs``).

### API documentation

[Latest API documentation is hosted at Apiary.io.](http://docs.naicsapi.apiary.io/)

### API example requests

__Warning!__ The URL (server and/or structure) is likely to change in the very near future. Do not use for production (yet).


### Usage

* A simple example demo search interface for NAICS codes [site](http://louh.github.io/naics-search) and [repository](https://github.com/louh/naics-search)

* Work in progress real-world application [site](http://lv-dof-staging.herokuapp.com/) and [repository](https://github.com/rclosner/lv-dof)


### Additional information

* An early NAICS scraper at [daguar/naics-scraper](https://github.com/daguar/naics-scraper/))

## Development setup (on Mac OS X 10.8)

### First-time setup

1) Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

2) Clone this repository to a folder on your computer. The rest of this document will refer to this folder as `$PROJECT_ROOT`.

3) Install project dependencies.

    cd $PROJECT_ROOT
    npm install

### Every time you sync $PROJECT_ROOT with the remote GitHub repo

1) Update the project dependencies.

    cd $PROJECT_ROOT
    npm install

### To start the REST API server

1) Start the REST API server.

    cd $PROJECT_ROOT
    npm start

## Contributing

### Help Needed

There are other data that can be included in the API. Not all of these are within the scope of the scraper however.

* Illustrative examples from 2007 NAICS
* Information from NAICS prior to 2007 (2002, 1997 - low priority)
* Data for converting between different NAICS codes and other systems, like SIC or NIGP

On the API side:

* The API should perform searches on all the available data and return relevant results from the requester (e.g. a business type lookup application)
* Close [existing issues][issues].
